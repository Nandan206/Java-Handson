# ðŸš— Java Car Simulation Program

This is a simple **Java OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** project that simulates a car object with basic behaviors like starting, driving, and stopping.

It uses two Java classes:
- `Car.java`: defines the properties and behaviors of a car
- `Main.java`: tests the Car object through method calls

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `Main.java`: Contains the `main()` method and creates a `Car` object.
- `Car.java`: Defines the `Car` class with attributes and methods.

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

- Classes and Objects
- Instance Variables
- Methods (`start()`, `drive()`, `stop()`)
- Boolean flags (`isRunning`)
- System output for simulation
